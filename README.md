SimsAnalysis
============

Paper and Scripts for the analysis of the modelled sims.

all the relevant plots and tables are automatically generated from
available data. To work on the paper, initially run:

`./make.sh` (linux, mac?)
`./make.cmd` (windows)

to generate all the data, plots and tables.

If you did not change any data (please, you really shouldn't
without a good reason), but you did change some plots captions and
layouts, for the autogenerated tex files, you can run

`./update.sh` or `update.cmd`

to only regenerate the `.tex` files and copy over the plots to the tex dir
once again. (plots will not be regenrated)
