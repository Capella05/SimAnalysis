# Paper about the SpaghettiLens and the Analysis of Sims


##recommended configuration:
###Windows:
install:
* Miktex
* SumatraPDF
* TexnicCenter
* JabRef

In this order, all GPL v3. Then you're ready to go by just opening `ms.tcp` in texniccenter.

To edit the references / bibliography I recommend jabref. `./bib/ms.bib`

###Linux:
use kile and according project file: `ms.kilepr`

###Mac:
directly open and edit `ms.tex`
