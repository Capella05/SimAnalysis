\section{SpaghettiLens} \label{sec:SpaghettiLens}

Give a guess for the maximum, minimum and saddle points.  Program
tries find $\kappa(x,y)$ that reproduces these properties exactly, and
looks reasonably like a galaxy.  Solution not unique, an ensemble
generated.

\section{The simulated lenses} \label{sec:sims}

Three kinds of sims.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Quasar:\/} A singular elliptical isothermal plus constant
  external shear, with a circular Gaussian source.
\item {\em Galaxy:\/} Lens as with quasar, but elliptical de
  Vaucouleurs source.
\item {\em Galaxy:\/} Lens is circular NFW plus one dominant
  elliptical SIE and perturbating elliptical SIEs, source as with
  galaxy.
\end{itemize}
Lenses follow \cite{2001astro.ph..2341K,2001astro.ph..2340K}.
Parameters in online supplement.
