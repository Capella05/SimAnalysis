\caption{1. col: id of model; 2.col: places of imgs idendited
  correctly; 3. col: more or less correct identification of extr
  points. 4.col: exact identification of extremal points. 5.col:
  type(s) of errors ocured....  1) inaccurate placement in an extended
  arc; 2) wrongly identified sad and min in 3 image configuration; 3)
  identified only 3 instead of 5 images; 4) tried to model an arc with
  a min instead of min-sad-min; 5) PI-err (rotation by 180 degrees; in
  5 image configuration, exchanged the ordering of the two saddle
  points); 6) PI/2-err (rotation by 90 degree; sad-min-sad-min-sad);
  7) missed faint image(s); 8) tried to model an arc with min-sad-min
  instead of only min; 9) did identify two close by images as one; 10)
  used 7 or more image to model a 5 image system. }
